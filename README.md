#Git search

  #### A website with a search engine geared to search for peoples Github Profile details. 26.03.18.

  #### By Lulu Mutuli

  ## The point of the website is to be able to search for a user based on their user name, and be able to receive a list of all their repositories with a link to the repositories.

  ## You do need to run a server to run this application. It was developed on angular 5, so make sure it is up to date. You do need to install some dependencies, but you will find all that information on app.module.ts. You are using JSON as a database so it would be good to keep that consistent.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

  ## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4400/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

  ## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

  ## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

  ## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

  ## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

  ## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

 ## There are no bugs, however a router module is needed and creates errors when implemented so, there may be an error somewhere that creates a conflict. Please do not hesitate to message me on lulumutuli24@gmail.com if you do run into any issues.
